## THE NEWSPAPER WORKS

# emma: Data Driven  
Masterpieces

# How we broke an entrenched monopoly by bringing the potential of good data to life.

### OBJECTIVE

For over 40 years, when it comes to readership measurement, the Australian media industry has been dominated by a single global player. In 2013, a bold new challenger was born: Enhanced Media Metrics Australia, or 'emma'. We were tasked with its launch, and to get Australia's 12 leading media agencies to trial it.

### SOLUTION

By delivering richer, more accurate data emma gives media planners a more vivid representation of the readers they are trying to understand. We brought this compelling truth to life, by bringing data to life -- literally.

1. We invited influential planners to write consumer profiles from emma data.
2. We breathed life into these profiles using Microsoft's Kinect technology and a specially created 'data processing' application. The result was a series of "Data Driven Masterpieces" that were at the heart of our campaign.
3. We created a series of films about the creation of the masterpieces, and presented our planners as the artists behind the work.
4. We rolled the campaign out across press, trade, in-agency and digital media.
