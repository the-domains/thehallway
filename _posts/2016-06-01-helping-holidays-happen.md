## ZUJI

# Helping Holidays Happen

How we helped make everyday items cheap so people can save for a holiday.

OBJECTIVE

Zuji is a travel booking website. Our task was to deliver a tough to reach audience to the website during difficult economic times and gain the spotlight in a crowded online travel market.

### SOLUTION

We introduced the positioning of 'Helping holidays happen'. We began creating a range of everyday products and selling them at ridiculously low prices. That way people could save more money for their holidays.

The first thing we did was produce and then launch our very own label of 10c baked beans. We then set up Zuji shops all over Australia and ran a campaign of print, outdoor, online, microsites, radio and DM to tell everyone about it. Every can was actually an ad for Zuji and people paid for Zuji ads by the thousand.

### RESULTS
