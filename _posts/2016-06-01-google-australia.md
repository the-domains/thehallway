# GOOGLE AUSTRALIA

# Ask the Google app

# HOW **WE INSTIGATED **THOUSANDS OF **MICRO MOMENTS **TO CHANGE SEARCH BEHAVIOUR.

### OBJECTIVE

In 2014 Australians were typically using a browser to search on their mobile. But the Google app offers a much better search experience. We needed to change this ingrained behaviour by driving awareness, downloads and daily usage of the app.

### SOLUTION

Instigate search moments in peoples' lives and encourage them to 'Ask the Google app'. Over 350 unique contextual headlines, tailored to more than 380 outdoor sites and 760 mobile executions, dynamically updating multiple times daily, contextual to major cities and served at specific landmarks based on geo targeting, automatically changing to reflect the weather via dynamic media, and reacting in minutes to major news events.

This hyper-contextual approach informed the entire campaign across 30 second TVCs, YouTube pre-rolls and mobile display.
