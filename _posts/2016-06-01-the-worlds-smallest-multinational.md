## SERVCORP

# The World's  
Smallest Multinational

# How we turned one man into a multinational corporation.

### OBJECTIVE

Drive awareness of among small business owners of Servcorp's Virtual Office product available in 22 countries across the world.

### SOLUTION

We leveraged a compelling insight: with Servcorp, even a one-man-band can have the footprint of a multinational company.

1. To prove this, we enlisted a budding entrepreneur called Sebastien and sent him off round the world to build Sebastien International -- The World's Smallest Multinational.
2. We followed him as he used Servcorp offices to host key meetings with investors and distributors.
3. We turned this into a compelling content series that was syndicated on relevant websites and blogs in the US, UK and Australia.
4. The campaign was supported by print and outdoor and took off in PR with coverage across more than 5,000 websites.
