### OBJECTIVE

Re-build The Whitsundays' social currency as a world-class holiday destination.

### SOLUTION

Get socially active, movie-loving Aussies to flood Facebook and Instagram with compelling 'ads' for the destination. Their motivation: the chance to win a luxury holiday by helping to create**The Whitsundays. A Movie That's Waiting To Be Written.**

1. We enlisted world-renowned screenwriter Craig Pearce as Script Supervisor.
2. We launched with a trailer, radio spots, online and social advertising.
3. We posted a movie storyboard image every day for 20 days, and invited the public to write the scenes.
4. When spread across social networks, every scene acted as a compelling 'ad' for The Whitsundays.
5. We reacted to the story as it developed, selecting and treating the next image according to each day's winning scene.
6. As the campaign closed, a Hollywood screenwriter and the Australian public had created the world's first crowd-sourced movie storyboard and a story universe with millions of possible narrative permutations.
