**The votes have been flooding in for the [People's Choice Award][0]for the[B&T Awards][1], so much so The Hallway has overtaken Resolution as the new leader**

That's not the only movement on the ladder though, as below are our top five biggest movers and shakers across the field this past week:

## COLUMBUS:

Columbus had a big rev up on Wednesday this week, so much so the fans, or potentially just all the employees, have pushed the agency into sixth place, up three spots from Monday.

## IKON COMMUNICATIONS:

Wednesday was clearly a good day for Ikon as well with its largest number of votes for the period so far.

## COLENSO BBDO:

While Colenso's biggest jump was last week, the agency has managed to sneak into the top ten (below) with a quick flurry of votes on Tuesday.

## BOHEMIA GROUP:

Furious clicking must have ensued at the Bohemia offices as the group pushed its way into the top ten on Monday. Other agencies however have since had a similar burst, and Bohemia now sits in 17th position.

## THE HALLWAY:

We have to mention The Hallway as it currently sits in first position, and dominates massive chunks of our People's Choice graph. The agency has definitely been the biggest mover and shaker this past week.

Voting is still open for another few weeks so it's by no means a done deal! Cast your vote[here][0].

We'll be closing the[survey][0]at 5pm on November 23, so get your skates on! And don't miss out on the actual Awards, which you can buy tickets for right[here][2].

The top ten as of 9am this morning, with the changes from Monday's top ten list.

1. The Hallway (up one spot)
2. Resolution (down one spot)
3. Carat Australia (remained the same)
4. Ikon Communications (up four spots)
5. Cadreon (remained the same)
6. Columbus (up three spots)
7. OMD (remained the same)
8. Isobar (down two spots)
9. The Monkeys (up one spot)
10. Colenso BBDO (new entrant)
